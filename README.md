# PCG-Signal-Processing
<p align="justify"> In this project (which was my bachelor's thesis as well), in the first step I have done some research about PCG signal processing, heart and lung sound signals, and seperation of heart and lung sound signals from the received PCG signals using neural networks and machine learning methods. </p>

<p align="justify"> I also have had a little participation in designing a device called "HEKIDESK" which is connected to an app designed by other members of our research group. In this way, PCG signals can be received and then processed. This device has other abilities like receiving ECG and PPG signals as well and process them and extract some important information. A part of this project that relates to PCG signal processing, is completely done by my research and under my programing knowledge of signal processing. </p>

You can find the results of the research in details in the files attached, and also the program files along with the datasets. 

<p align="justify"> In the following figures you can see the primary board designed for collecting signals. This board is going to be developed in a case that if any abnormalities detected, the patient would be warned so that many dangerous diseases can be avoided. Therefore, the future goal of this project is to improve the processing of signals in case of better classification (with more classes to reach more detailed information), and also improve the device and the app in case of having communication with the patients to warn them if any abnormalities happen and inform them about their health state. </p>
